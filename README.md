## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

**Clone the Repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RPinkha/June-Code-Jam-2024.git
  cd June-Code-Jam-2024
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
Install requirments.txt to run .py and .ipynb files locally: 

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Export Data to JSON

If the final parks dataset ever needs to be changed, run the cell in the .ipynb file in /notebooks:

```
top_9_parks.to_csv('final_9parks.csv', index=False)
```

This will write an updated final_9parks.csv file to /notebooks.

Next, from the root folder, cd into cd src/scripts/ and run `python export_data_to_json.py` to write an updated JSON file to /data.

This should update the existing JSON file in /data/parks_data.json. This JSON file is now ready to use as a JavaScript import, etc.

### Datasets used:

**nationparks.csv** - "The United States National Parks" - includes Name, Visitors, Date Established, Description and Area. 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/the-united-states-national-parks 

**us-national-parks.json** - "us-national-parks" - includes Longitutde, Latitude, park info and descripton. 

https://data.world/kevinnayar/us-national-parks

**final_9parks.csv** - Final cleaned .csv for [download](https://github.com/RPinkha/June-Code-Jam-2024/blob/main/src/notebooks/final_9parks.csv) and use in the project.

- *name*: Name of National Park
- *visitors*: Number of annual visitors for 2021
- *description*: Provided description of the park
- *date_established*:
- *longitude*: Longitude coordinate of the park
- *latitude*: Latitude coordinate of the park
- *area_km2*: Total area of the park in square kilometers

The datasets were merged to conatin the above information for 63 national parks in the Unites States.The data underwent an initial preprocessing stage as part of an exploratory data analysis (EDA), during which they were carefully parsed, relabeled, and sorted. Additionally, corrections were made to ensure consistency in type and format.

Using the data, we found the 9 top most vistied parks, and from there plan out a route that is ordered by most-visited, or ideally, the Optimal Route.
